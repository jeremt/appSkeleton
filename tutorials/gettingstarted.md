This application skeleton is actually pretty easy to use. You just have to do these 3 steps:

### Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jeremt/appSkeleton.git
```

### Install the depdencencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

(TODO: automatically update bower)

### Run the build system

```sh
$ gulp
```

### Finished!

That's all, now you can visit http://localhost:3002 and start working on your application ;).
